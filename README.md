Welcome to the humanoid_challenge wiki, Following are some Software tutorials of 'ROBOTIS MINI', OpenCM is used as a development Software and download tool for the OpenCM9.04 embedded board. Python programming code is used to control the higher level of Robotis mini and its movement. Tutorial 1- 5 will discuss about the structure, basics of Robotis Mini, how to control each motors, kinematics and different motion including the difficult walking motion.

In the Special tutorial Section 1-3 we try to show the upper level of software and hardware structure, communication, sample communication programming, Object detection and recognition, using the object recognition technique to command the robot and most important how to control the Remote computer in Robotis Mini which in our case is Raspberry pi from ground station linux computer.
